Suppose we have the following predicates:
    P(x, y): person x is partners with person y
    CS(x): person x is a CS major
    ECE(x): person x is an ECE major
    KS(x): person x is from Kansas

For each statement:
Translate it to English, Negate it, showing your work (any OR statement should be
    converted to an ->),  Translate your negation to English

1. ∀ x (KS(x) V ¬CS(x))

Translation:

Negation:

Translation of negation: There is a person who isn't from KS and is a CS major




2. ∃ x (ECE(x) ^ ∀ y (KS(y) → P(x, y)))
